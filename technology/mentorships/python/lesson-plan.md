# Lesson Plan

1. Basic Programming
>Learn the basics of python! We will go over some basic programming concepts and how to implement them in python.{.is-info}
---
2. File I/O ( input/output )
>Use features of your operating system to interface, read & write files. This is useful in gathering data from arbitrary sources, processing said data, and exporting it in a meaningful form factor.{.is-info}
---
3. Intermediate Programming
>Expand on the knowledge previously. We will also use more complex data types to structure data in a more intuitive way.{.is-info}
---
4. Object-Oriented Principles
>We will go over the fundamentals, why you would use object-oriented design and how to implement them{.is-info}
---
5. Binary Operations
>Learn what happens "under the hood" of our machines day-to-day, and what happens when you run a python script.{.is-info}
---
6. Consuming an API
>We will use canvas to extract information such as announcements and assignment due dates.{.is-info}
---
7. Graphing
>Find out how to make cool graphs from data gathered from various sources after sanitising and processing said data.{.is-info}
