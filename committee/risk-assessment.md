# How to make a risk assessment

1. Download a template from the list below, and fill out/change any necessary details.
1. Export to PDF and (preferably) send both `.docx` and `.pdf` to healthandsafety@uccsocieties.ie, with topical email subject and body
1. Wait for an approval/request for change.
	- This will likely take at least three days, if it is an urgent RA, add `URGENT` to the mail subject
