3. Then fill in details in the form generally say 20-30 attending, if the room you are attempting to book doesn't appear in the search, scroll down to the next section.

## Room not in Bookings List

- If the room is the SU Common Room, search for the booking form .docx in a past email thread with C.Kennedy@ucc.ie, include it with an email detailing the dates you want booked, and an approved risk assessment.

- If the room is somewhere in WGB (including the atrium/canteen), contact the Head of Computer Science & IT dept. (Utz Roedig), or look through the past email threads to figure out who to contact.

- If the room is in the Student Hub, such as the atrium, contact eodriscoll@ucc.ie.
