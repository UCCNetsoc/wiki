# Switch

## (MANUAL) Configuration

The switch listens on `10.0.90.2`

You can telnet into the switch on 10.0.90.2 or use SSH (with an insecure cipher spec) from any server which has a bridge that tags to VLAN 90. See VLAN config below

Remote SPAN VLANs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Primary Secondary Type              Ports
------- --------- ----------------- ------------------------------------------
```

All servers have a trunk connection (contains all vlans) that is not connected to WAN.

The Proxmox machine which runs the virtual router has an extra connection: a WAN access link. Both are passed through directly to the VM.

#### 10 - wan

* Connected to the uplink
* Some VMs have a NIC on this WAN because they have a direct public IP

#### 20 - proxmox

* Contains every Proxmox host

#### 30 - infra

* Contains every 'infrastructure' VM we host, e.g:
	* A 'games' VM for gameservers
  * Our main web VM that hosts our website, this wiki, our Discord Bot & our CI

#### 80 - Out-of-Band

* Currently not setup

#### 90 - Management VLAN

* The switch _only_ and our VyOS router listen on this VLAN

### Adding/modifying VLANs

Each VLAN must be configured and enabled on the switch.

If you want to use a VLAN inside a Proxmox VM, you will need to add a bridge device in the Proxmox UI and tag the VLAN on that VM's NIC.

![proxmox-network-bridge.png](/assets/proxmox-network-bridge.png)

# Router

We use the virtual router VyOS running in a VM. It is attached directly to the vmbr0 bridge that receives all trunk traffic, so it can see all VLANs. The virtual NIC attached to the VM is not tagged
https://www.vyos.io/


## (MANUAL) Configuration

VyOS listens on SSH on `10.0.90.1`. The login user is `vyos`

### VLAN default gateway IPs

Each VLAN occupies it's own subnet

VyOS is configured to provide default gateway on each VLAN so we can route packets between VLANs using firewall zones. It always provides this gateway on the first IP of the network

Note that not every VLAN has a similar subnet mask:

* The infra vlan (id 30) is a `10.0.30.0/24` because we don't expect to have many infra VM IPs (0-255)
	* It's gateway is still +1 10.0.30.1
* But the cloud vlan (id 40) is a `10.40.0.0/16` because we expect to have many allocations over time (0-65k)
	* It's gateway is still +1 10.40.0.1

[See `vlan` and `subnet` here for more info](https://github.com/UCCNetsoc/NaC/blob/master/vars/network.yml#L14)

### Firewall zones

* TODO(ocanty)

### NAT

* We use NAT rules in VyOS to allocate ports across hosts, we typically only use NAT on 1 IP
	* Currently NAT is setup to proxy the SSH (22) and WebUI ports (8006) to the Proxmox 'control' host (feynman) and expose them to the real world
  

# IP allocations

## (MANUAL) Proxmox host

Proxmox hosts live on the `proxmox` VLAN

`lovelace` can be found on 10.0.20.52
`feynman` can be found on 10.0.20.53

Our other 3 servers are currently awaiting replacement or installation of Proxmox


## (ANSIBLE) VM IP allocations
 
IP allocations for our infra VMs are managed in our IaC
 
[See `interfaces` here](https://github.com/UCCNetsoc/NaC/blob/master/vars/network.yml)

## Exposed to the internet - what do we use each public IP for?

`84.39.234.50` - Currently unused
`84.39.234.51` - The public IP of our web infra VM
`84.39.234.52` - Currently unused
`84.39.234.53` - The public IP we use for mapping NAT ports to Proxmox hosts and sometimes VMs
`84.39.234.54` - Currently unused

From [CloudCIX rocky](https://github.com/CloudCIX/rocky)
```
Rocky is designed to operate in an out of band (OOB) network, serarated from other CloudCIX networks. Rocky's purpose is to facilitate monitoring, testing, debug and recovery. By convention, Rocky uses OOB addresses that are IPV4, RFC1918 addresses in the form 10.S.R.U/16 where...

S represents the Site Number. If you are taking a CloudCIX support contract you will be informed of the S octet to use. Otherwise, you can choose any number you wish between 0 and 255. Each Support Number represents a VPN tunnel used by the CloudCIX support centre to reach the site.
R represents the Rack. It can be any number from 1 to 255. If you have a multi-rack SRXPod then it is recommended to number them from 1 upwards sequentially. If you have a site with multiple SRXPods then different R numbers must be used. The R number must be unique within a Site.
U represents the U location within the Rack of the device.
