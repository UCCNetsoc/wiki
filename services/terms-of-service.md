# Support

Requests for support can only be sent and handled via:
* The `#servers` channel in the UCC Netsoc Discord server (https://discord.netsoc.co)
* Email sent to and from netsoc@uccsocieties.ie
 
We can **only** provide support for the following scope of issues:
* Networking issues
	* e.g. slow connection speed, no connection at all
* Control panel:
	* e.g. control panel not performing correctly, bugs, messages asking user to contact us
* Instance templates issues:
	* e.g. a feature missing, feature request, bug or error in configuration of the template
* Hardware:
	* e.g. CPU speed issues, slow I/O

We cannot guarantee a response or resolution for any request sent to support

You are responsible for the day to day management of your instances. Users should be familiar with Linux systems administration to manage their instances. Users are responsible for keeping software on their instance patched and up to date as required.

# Backups

* UCC Netsoc does not typically take backups of instance data.
	* Users should be aware that keeping off-site backups of their data on a personal storage device or alternative backup solution is recommended

* Where backups are available, we cannot guarantee the speed of restoration, reliability or data integrity of said backups

* UCC Netsoc will hold no responsibility for user data loss


# Monitoring

Network traffic and instances are monitored in circumstances where:
* There is reason to suspect that the ToS is being breached
* The purposes of problem solving
* Where UCC Netsoc has other legitimate reasons for doing so.

You must therefore be aware that such monitoring is taking place.
