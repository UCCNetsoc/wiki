## Summary


The UCC Networking, Gaming and Technology Society (Netsoc) prides itself on many things: Our inclusiveness; Diversity; Passion and Experience. However our style and aesthetic cannot be overlooked when creating content that represents us.

Netsoc’s style is mostly professional (with the exception of our Gaming Nights) with a penchant for [flat design](https://en.wikipedia.org/w![logo-horizontal.svg](/assets/logo-horizontal.svg)iki/Flat_design) and simplicity. This shall be kept in mind when designing content to be distrubuted over any of our networks ([Facebook](https://facebook.com/UCCNetsoc), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uccnetsoc), [netsoc.co](http://netsoc.co/), etc...)

Be **bold** yet professional. Make use of quality photography and imagery. Resources like Unsplash or [Librestock](http://librestock.com) provide excellent, high-resolution imagery to use that complements our aesthetic.

## Logo

Netsoc’s main logo consists of four distinct elements:

### 1\. "NETSOC" in uppercase

![](/assets/logo-text.png)

The official font for the Netsoc logo is Niteweit Bold. If this font is unavailable, [League Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan) should be used as an alternative. However, it is not recommended to attempt to remake the Netsoc logo.

### 2\. A desktop computer (Networking)

### 3\. A series of binary digits (Technology)

### 4\. A game controller (Gaming)

#### Alternate Logos

##### Horizontal With Tagline

The Netsoc Logo can be used in several ways and comes in several forms:

*   With the logo alone
*   The logo and the text "NETSOC" to the right
*   The logo and "NETSOC" below it in appropriate proportions (i.e. the text the same width as the logo)
*   The logo, "NETSOC" to the right and our formal title, "UCC Networking, Gaming and Technology Society", in [League Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan)

A certain degree of clear space should be given to the Netsoc logo to separate it from any background elements.

*   Official icon: equal to height of the Netsoc name.
*   Horizontal logo: equal to one-quarter of the height of the logo on all sides.

## Color

We’re not fussy when it comes to the color of our logo, it’s even appeared [in full rainbow](https://www.facebook.com/NetsocUCC/photos/a.760170814044806.1073741826.760170744044813/885975008131052/?type=3&permPage=1). We typically use black or white on transparent however once the logo’s color compliments the rest of the graphic and isn’t a jarring color like electric pink or yellow on red we’re happy.

If you’re uncertain of any design featuring our logo, just ask our PRO or Auditor if we’ve any feedback.

### Netsoc Blue

Traditionallly, the society has made use of a _Netsoc Blue_ colour scheme

Netsoc Blue is not a required standard for Netsoc content but can be used as a helpful guideline to choosing a Netsoc colour scheme:

## Fonts

Netsoc has no specific rules about fonts, but we have a preference for:

*   [League Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan)
*   [Bebas Neue](http://www.fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/)
*   [Roboto](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)

Our Logo font is a commercial font called Niteweit
 * if you do not have a copy, please ask for one, but be aware it is **only** used in the logo context.

## Name

The _UCC Networking, Gaming and Technology Society_ is the full, formal name of the society. This may be shortened to **"Netsoc"** on campus, mailing lists or posters, or **"UCC Netsoc"** when refering to Netsoc outside of UCC (e.g. media, press) only. Do not use constituant parts of the name to form a shortened version other than the aforementioned "Netsoc" or "UCC Netsoc". Examples of shorter versions of our name that should **not** be used include:

*   NETSOC (except as part of our [logo](#logo))
*   The NetSoc Society
*   The Networking Society
*   The Gaming Society
*   GameSoc
*   CompSoc
